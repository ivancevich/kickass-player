Kickass Player
==============

Look for music on Kickass Torrents and play it directly from the CLI

### Usage
Run `npm install && npm start` and Kickass Player will ask you what do you wanna listen to.

### Notice
Doesn't work with io.js for now :(

### Troubleshooting
If you have problems running this app, possibly you need to install some system libraries to make both [Lame](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-lame) and [Speaker](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker) work.
