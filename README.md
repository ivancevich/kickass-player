Kickass Player
==============

Look for music on Kickass Torrents and play it directly from the CLI

### Usage
Run `node index.js "you search"` in your CLI, and music will start playing right away.
If you don't pass a search, Kickass Player will play what is on the main music section.

### Troubleshooting
If you have problems running this app, possibly you need to install some system libraries to make both [Lame](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-lame) and [Speaker](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker) work.
